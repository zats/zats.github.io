GameplayKit brings random numbers generation among other useful things. So what's the difference between `GKRandomDistribution`, `GKGaussianDistribution` and `GKShuffledDistribution`? 
As the name suggests, `GKShuffledDistribution` is useful for when you want to simulate card deck behaviour. Pulling a random card one after another. Until you go through entire deck, there is no way you will see the same card twice (putting magic tricks aside).
`GKGaussianDistribution` is targeting problem of generating random numbers around the center of the range (2 in the example below). Here is a little sample, illustrating the differences:

{% gist zats/b8d9da7effd89b0e5400 %}

Here is the output it produces:

| Value | Random | Shuffled | Gausian |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | 
| 1 | 5 | 10 | 2 |
| 2 | 14 | 10| 26 |
| 3 | 11 | 10 | 2 | 

And a visual version:

Although `GKRandomDistribution` instance produces equally distributed random numbers, it can result in so called "lucky streaks" - getting same value several times in a row. That's exactly when you want to use `GKShuffledDistribution`. As for `GKGaussianDistribution`, it targets cases when you need to generate random numbers around center, not getting too close to the upper and lower bounds (1 and 3 in our example). 

Very welcomed additions to Cocoa family.
