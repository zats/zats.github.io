A great idea found at http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2015/08/04/fizzbuzz-with-ios-9-gameplaykit-expert-system-in-c-with-xam-ios and backported to swift.

[Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a simple game. GameplayKit makes it very easy to describe the rules. There is a vast place for improvement when working with state untyped dictionary. It can definitely use some swiftification. Here is the code:

{% gist zats/0ad1dac35e75587da7e0 fizzbuzz.swift %}

Output is

```
1
2
fizz 
4
buzz 
fizz 
7
8
fizz 
buzz 
11
fizz 
13
14
fizz buzz 
16
...
```

I'm looking forward to seeing frameworks emerging on top of GameplayKit.
