A great idea found at [knowing.net](http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2015/08/04/fizzbuzz-with-ios-9-gameplaykit-expert-system-in-c-with-xam-ios) and backported to swift.

[Fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a simple game and GameplayKit API making it equally simple to describe the rules. Untyped state dictionary can definitely use some "swiftification", but overall, code is quite simple. Here it is:

{% gist zats/0ad1dac35e75587da7e0 fizzbuzz.swift %}

Output is

```
1
2
fizz 
4
buzz
...
```

I'm looking forward to seeing gaming and not only frameworks emerging on top of GameplayKit! Foundation is very promising.
